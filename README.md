You **CAN** use these scripts to see what the scripts look like
You **CAN** use these scripts as inspiration
You **CAN** take the code for **anything other than competetions** most competitons **will** *disqualaify* you for **using others code**

## Help

If you have difficultly with the scripts please follow these steps

**Code not running?**]

Probably a "Start-Sleep" command, if you don't want to wait use **Ctrl+C**

**Script won't run?**

Probably means that scripts are disabled! To check use "**Get-ExecutionPolicy**"
If it says "**Restricted**" use  "**Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted**"
Make sure you run the script as **administrator**!!!!

**Part of script blocked?**

Try gaining ownership of the **System32** folder if you are on a 64 bit computer.
Try gaining ownership of the **SysWOW64** folder if you are on a 32 bit computer.

I am **not liable** for you **deleting important files**, the scripts have been **used and tested in competetions**

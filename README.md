If you have difficultly with the scripts please follow these steps

**Code not running?**
Probably a "Start-Sleep" command, if you don't want to wait use **Ctrl+C**

**Script won't run?**
Probably means that scripts are disabled! To check use "**Get-ExecutionPolicy**"
If it says "**Restricted**" use  "**Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted**"
